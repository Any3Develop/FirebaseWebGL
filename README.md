# FirebaseWebGL
A Unity package that makes use of the Firebase Javascript SDK to make use of the basic Realtime Database functions on WebGL builds

## Installation
- Copy the FirebaseWebGL folder into your Unity project assets folder.
- Alternatively,  you can import the latest .unitypackage from the repository releases

## Usage
  1) Call any of the basics Firebase Javascript SDK functions from the FirebaseBridge.cs class
  2) Build for WebGL
  3) Include the Firebase app configuration in the index.html file generated by Unity (you can use this tutorial [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#from-the-cdn)).
  4) Finally, make sure to also include the Firebase SDKs you need to use in your App (Step 5 of the previous link).
  
## Additional info
- As of right now, only the basic functions of the Realtime Database Firebase service have been worked on, but you can expect more services coming soon to provide for a fuller Firebase WebGL experience.
